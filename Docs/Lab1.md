Lab 1 Directions
Write a C program for a mile to kilometer conversion to run on ocelot. (1 Mile = 1.60934 Kilometers)

The source file should have your name & PantherID included in it and it should have an affirmation of originality stating something like: “I affirm that I wrote this program myself without any help form any other people or sources from the internet.”. 

It is expected that this program and the programs from this class follow programming standards learned in previous classes. There should be a program description at the top as well as descriptions of all functions used in the code.

Code should be nicely indented using a consistent style and commented appropriately.

Indentation
You can choose to indent your code 2, 3, or 4 spaces for each level of nesting as long as you are consistent throughout the code. If you modify a file, then you should make all indentation in that file match your style.

Curly Braces
You can choose either style for your curly braces, but be consistent:

if (...) {

}

Or

if (...)

{

}

Create a nicely formatted chart with the conversions of each of the following values from Miles to Kilometers. There is no user input, these values can be constants in the program.

5
1.75
400
2875
Columns should be aligned with numbers right justified and rounded to 5 digits after the decimal place.

Create a simple Makefile to compile your program into an executable called convertmiles.

You should submit a compressed zip file named FirstNameLastNameL1.zip with the following files.

The source code, convertmiles.c
The Makefile file which should be called Makefile with no extension.  I should be able to type make at the command line to compile your program.
A screenshot of the output of the program running on ocelot (be sure the command line prompt shows.) The screenshot should just be a file named with your FirstNameLastName.png or .jpg.
Do not include any other files or folders in the zipfile.

Programs that do not compile and do something useful when run will not earn any credit at all.
